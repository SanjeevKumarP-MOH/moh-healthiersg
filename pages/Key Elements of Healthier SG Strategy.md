Healthier SG is a multi-year strategy to transform the way we deliver healthcare, by shifting our emphasis from reactively caring for those who are already sick, to proactively preventing individuals from falling ill.

Against the backdrop of an ageing population and the rising impact of chronic diseases, Healthier SG aims to empower individuals to become healthier and improve their quality of life through preventive care and strong patient-doctor relationships, supported by the community and our three clusters - the National Healthcare Group (NHG), National University Health System (NUHS) and SingHealth (SHS).

The White Paper on Healthier SG was submitted to Parliament on 21 September 2022 and will be debated in Parliament in October 2022. The key elements of Healthier SG are shaped by the consultations the Ministry of Health (MOH) conducted with over 6,000 residents and stakeholders, such as private General Practitioners (GP) employers and community partners.
