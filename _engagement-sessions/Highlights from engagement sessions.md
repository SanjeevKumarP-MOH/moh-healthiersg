### 5 engagement sessions, close to 500 participants

Since the launch of our HealthierSG public consultation on 18 May, close to 500 Singaporeans have joined us physically at our engagement sessions, and over 2,500 have contributed their views via our online survey. 

Most of the feedback concerned having a dedicated doctor or clinic, preventive health plan, and community support. 

These views and suggestions are valuable, to help us get a sense of what matters most to people, and how best to design the scheme to make it work. It will shape the White Paper to be tabled in Parliament later this year.

“I believe everyone should have a family doctor whom you can lean on, who can look out for you.  
  
My extended family has been going to the same family doctor for years, starting with my parents, and now my own family as well. Over the years, our doctor has become more like a family friend – someone we can trust, who is always there for us", says Y. Mahalakshmi, when asked on her thoughts about having a regular family doctor.  
  
Mahalakshmi was one of the many Singaporeans who attended the first [#HealthierSG](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/healthiersg/) engagement session at Singapore Polytechnic on 26 May 2022.

“I'm at the age when it's not so easy for me to run anymore. So instead, I try to walk as much as I can. My target is to clock 10,000 steps a day.  
  
I also keep fit by doing some cycling, stretching, and joining yoga classes organised by the Health Promotion Board. Hope to see more of such activities in the community!", says Yee Kin Sing, when asked about the kind of healthy activities he enjoys.  
  
Kin Sing was one of the many Singaporeans who attended the second [#HealthierSG](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/healthiersg/) engagement session at the National Library on 1 June 2022.

“This initiative of a health plan is actually really good. It will not just be for me, but for my family as well.  
  
“I recently went to see my GP to get some advice, as I have been trying to lose weight. With this initiative of a health plan, my family will also be able to benefit from healthier living – from our diet, the exercise programmes we can attend, and so on. So, I support this initiative”, says Sufi Rizzan, when asked about what a health plan means to him.  
  
Sufi was one of the many Singaporeans who attended the fourth [#HealthierSG](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/healthiersg/) engagement session on 11 June 2022.
