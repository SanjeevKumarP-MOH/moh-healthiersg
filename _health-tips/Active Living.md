It is no secret that regular physical activity can bring about an array of health benefits, from improving your physical and mental health, helping with weight management to keeping diseases away. All you need to do is engage in 150 to 300 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise every week.

Here are some tips to help you kickstart, and stay on top of your fitness journey:
### Start slow

When starting an exercise programme, always start slow. Your body needs time to adjust to the increased physical activity, especially if you have not been active. This will help to prevent injuries and the potential onset of muscle soreness. You can subsequently increase the intensity and duration of your activity as your fitness level improves. 

### Choose a physical activity that interests you

Sticking to the same exercise routine may become boring after a while, and may cause you to lose interest in exercising altogether. Try injecting variety into your workout routine by picking up a new sport or activity such as Zumba, kickboxing or yoga. Better yet, get your family and friends to join you in these activities so you can motivate one another. 
### Incorporate physical activity into your daily routine

It can be challenging for some of us to find the time and motivation to exercise regularly amidst our hectic lifestyles. After all, not everyone can afford to carve out an hour or two to head to the gym. 

For those of you who are time-starved, consider incorporating physical activity into your daily routine. Heading to work? Alight one or two stops earlier and walk the rest of the way to the office. Watching television? Try doing some jumping jacks or planks while doing so. Over time, these small actions will add up and help you stay active and healthy.
