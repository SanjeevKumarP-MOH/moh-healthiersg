**Healthier Singapore** is our push to help all Singaporeans take steps for better health, anchoring in the adage “Prevention is better than cure”. 

In the last decade, we looked beyond healthcare to health, and have built a good healthcare system.

But a good healthcare system is not the end. We need to move towards better health and quality of life for each of us. 

With Healthier SG, we will enable each Singaporean to:

a)	Know their chosen family physician who will provide care for them

b)	Know what preventive care steps they can take to improve their health 

c)	Know that they can take steps for better health any time they want

#### One GP and One Health Plan for Every One

Central to Healthier SG is enabling a trusted lifelong relationship between each Singaporean and their Family Physician.

* They will work with their family physician to develop a personalised health plan, with a focus on preventive health such as adherence to nationally recommended health screenings and vaccinations. 
* They will be encouraged to visit the same family physician regularly for all their care needs and discuss their health goals. 
* They will be able to visit their family physician to discuss their current health condition and how they can improve their health and concerns at each stage of life. 

#### An Ecosystem of Support for Better Health 

To support Singaporeans in their care journey and meet health needs, the regional health clusters will work towards developing an integrated health and social ecosystem within their region. 

They will partner agencies such as the [Health Promotion Board (HPB)](https://hpb.gov.sg/), [Agency for Integrated Care (AIC)](https://www.aic.sg/), [People’s Association (PA)](https://www.pa.gov.sg/), [Sports SG](https://www.myactivesg.com/), [National Parks Board (NParks)](https://www.nparks.gov.sg/) and social and community partners to support care needs. 

For a start, we will focus on enabling everyone to know how and where they can access more physical activities and healthier diets. They will be able to choose the activities that suit them best. 

For those who are more senior, the regional health clusters and the family physicians will be able to advise how they can attend healthy activities and programmes, such as via the local eldercare centre.

#### National Healthier SG Enrolment Programme

All these elements come together in the national Healthier SG enrolment programme. Each resident will be enrol with a GP clinic of their choice. 

With this, each resident will be kept updated on the recommended health screening and vaccinations. Starting early on preventive care will help reduce health risks, identify early developing conditions and make timely interventions.

We will start enrolment for those 40 years old and above, and extend to more ages over time.
