**Healthier Singapore** is a new programme that anchors in the adage “Prevention is better than cure”.

The preventive care approach drives efforts upstream to keep individuals healthy, address risk factors and receive early interventions so that any downstream serious health conditions (for e.g. diabetes and heart diseases), can be mitigated.

This approach helps every individual reduce health risks and achieve good health outcomes in the long term.

#### One GP and One Care Plan for Every One

Central to Healthier SG is a trusted relationship between the Family Doctor and Patient which ensures a continuous care delivery for different health episodes, throughout the life-course.

Singaporeans will be encouraged to visit the same family doctor regularly for all their care needs and discuss their health goals.

They will work together with the same doctor to develop a personalized care plan that may include health screenings, vaccinations, discussion of health goals such as making dietary or lifestyle changes, addressing risk factors and exploring ways to achieving these health goals and delaying the onset of diseases. 

#### An Ecosystem of Support for Better Health 

To support Singaporeans in their care journey and meet health needs, the regional health clusters (NHG, NUHS and SingHealth) will also provide an integrated health and social ecosystem within their regions.

They will partner agencies such as the Health Promotion Board (HPB), Agency for Integrated Care (AIC), People’s Association (PA), SportsSG, National Parks Board and community partners to offer healthy lifestyle programmes, eldercare services, interest and peer support groups, depending on the health goals. 

#### National Healthier SG Enrolment Programme

Healthier SG is planned for roll out in 2023, where every resident will be invited to enroll with a family doctor of their choice as their first line of care and ensure continuity of care. 

The programme will be coordinated by the three healthcare clusters, so that Singaporeans can get care and support near where they live. But they will still have the choice on who they want to enroll with.
