**Healthier Singapore** is our push to help all Singaporeans take steps for better health, anchoring in the adage “Prevention is better than cure”. 

In the last decade, we looked beyond healthcare to health, and have built a good healthcare system.

But a good healthcare system is not the end. We need to move towards better health and quality of life for each of us. 

With Healthier SG, we will enable each Singaporean to:

a)	Know their chosen family physician who will provide care for them

b)	Know what preventive care steps they can take to improve their health 

c)	Know that they can take steps for better health any time they want

#### One GP and One Health Plan for Every One

Central to Healthier SG is enabling a trusted lifelong relationship between each Singaporean and their Family Physician.

* They will work with their family physician to develop a personalised health plan, with a focus on preventive health such as adherence to nationally recommended health screenings and vaccinations. 
* They will be encouraged to visit the same family physician regularly for all their care needs and discuss their health goals. 
* They will be able to visit their family physician to discuss their current health condition and how they can improve their health and concerns at each stage of life. 

#### An Ecosystem of Support for Better Health 

To support Singaporeans in their care journey and meet health needs, the regional health clusters will work towards developing an integrated health and social ecosystem within their region. They will partner agencies such as the [Health Promotion Board (HPB)](https://hpb.gov.sg/), [Agency for Integrated Care (AIC)](https://www.aic.sg/), [People’s Association (PA)](https://www.pa.gov.sg/), [Sports SG](https://www.myactivesg.com/), [National Parks Board (NParks)](https://www.nparks.gov.sg/) and social and community partners to support care needs. 

For a start, we will focus on enabling everyone to know how and where they can access more activities that promote more physical activity and better diet. We will be able to choose the activities that suit us best. 

For those who are more senior, the regional health clusters and the family physicians in the area will be able to advise how you can attend healthy activities and programmes, such as via the local eldercare centre.

There are three Regional Health clusters in Singapore – [National Healthcare Group (NHG)](http://corp.nhg.com.sg/), [National University Health System (NUHS)](https://www.nuhs.edu.sg/) and [SingHealth](https://www.singhealth.com.sg/). Each cluster is responsible for organizing care in their areas, working closely with health and social partners, to deliver better health for all residents.

#### National Healthier SG Enrolment Programme

All of these elements will come together as the national Healthier SG enrolment programme. Each resident will be invited to choose which primary care clinic they wish to enrol with, regardless of where they stay.

We will focus Healthier SG first on preventive care. Each resident will be kept updated on the recommended health screening and vaccinations which they can complete in their own time. Starting early on preventive care will help us reduce health risks, spot any early developing conditions and enable discussions with our family physician on how we can achieve good health for ourselves.

We will start with 40 years old and above, as this is when chronic conditions are likely to start developing. We will extend to more ages over time.
