**Healthier SG** will help all Singaporeans take steps towards better health.  

We have built a good healthcare system in Singapore, but we need to focus on better health and quality of life for everyone. 

With Healthier SG, we will enable all Singaporeans to

a)	Know your chosen family doctor who will provide care for you

b)	Know what preventive care steps you can take to improve your health 

c)	Know that you can take steps for better health any time you want

#### One Family Doctor and One Health Plan for Everyone

We want all Singaporeans to have a trusted and lifelong relationship with your family doctor.   

* Your family doctor will work with you to develop a personalised health plan. Based on your profile, you will be encouraged to go for nationally recommended health screenings and vaccinations. 

* You will be encouraged to visit your chosen family doctor regularly for all your care needs and discuss your health goals.

* Across every stage of your life, your chosen family doctor will discuss your health condition with you and address any health concerns you may have. 

#### An Ecosystem of Support for Better Health 

The three regional health clusters – [SingHealth](https://www.singhealth.com.sg/), [National University Health System (NUHS)](https://www.nuhs.edu.sg/) and [National Healthcare Group (NHG)](https://corp.nhg.com.sg/) will work towards developing an integrated health and social ecosystem within their region. 

They will partner agencies such as the [Health Promotion Board (HPB)](https://hpb.gov.sg/), [Agency for Integrated Care (AIC)](https://www.aic.sg/), [People’s Association (PA)](https://www.pa.gov.sg/), [Sports SG](https://www.myactivesg.com/) and social and community partners to support your health goals. 

For a start, you will be able to access more physical activities and healthier diets, and you will be able to choose the activities that suit you best. 

If you are older, the regional health clusters and your family doctor will advise you on how you can attend healthy activities and programmes, such as at the local eldercare centre.
