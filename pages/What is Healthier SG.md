**Healthier Singapore** is our push to help all Singaporeans take steps for better health, anchoring in the adage “Prevention is better than cure”. 

From healthcare to health. 

We have built a good healthcare system. 

But better health is not just a healthcare system. It is about better health and quality of life for each of us. 

With Healthier SG, we will work with Singaporeans to understand how we can better care for ourselves and our health. And have more time and energy to do the things that we want.

With Healthier SG, we will enable each Singaporean to

a)	Know who is the doctor who cares for them

b)	Know what preventive health steps they can take to improve their help 

c)	Know that they can take steps for better health any time they want

#### One GP and One Care Plan for Every One

Central to Healthier SG is enabling a trusted lifelong relationship between each Singaporean and their Family Physician.

* Each of us will be encouraged to visit the same family doctor regularly for all their care needs and discuss their health goals.
* Each of us will be able to visit their doctor to discuss more than just their current health condition, but to discuss how they can improve their health and their concerns at each stage of life. 
Singaporeans will be encouraged to visit the same family doctor regularly for all their care needs and discuss their health goals.

Each of us will work together with our family physician to develop a personalised care plan, with a focus on preventive health such as nationally recommended health screenings and vaccinations. 

#### An Ecosystem of Support for Better Health 

To support Singaporeans in their care journey and meet health needs, the regional health clusters will work towards developing an integrated health and social ecosystem within their region. They will partner agencies such as the [Health Promotion Board (HPB)](https://hpb.gov.sg/), [Agency for Integrated Care (AIC)](https://www.aic.sg/), [People’s Association (PA)](https://www.pa.gov.sg/), [Sports SG](https://www.myactivesg.com/), [National Parks Board (NParks)](https://www.nparks.gov.sg/) and social and community partners to support care needs. 

For a start, we will focus on enabling everyone to know how and where they can access more activities that promote more physical activity and better diet. We will be able to choose the activities that suit us best. 

For those who are more senior, the regional health clusters and the family physicians in the area will be able to advise how you can attend healthy activities and programmes, such as via the local eldercare centre.

#### National Healthier SG Enrolment Programme

All of these elements will come together as the national Healthier SG enrolment programme. Each resident will be invited to choose which primary care clinic they wish to enrol with, regardless of where they stay.

We will focus Healthier SG first on preventive care. Each resident will be kept updated on the recommended health screening and vaccinations which they can complete in their own time. Starting early on preventive care will help us reduce health risks, spot any early developing conditions and enable discussions with our family physician on how we can achieve good health for ourselves.

We will start with 40 years old and above, as this is when chronic conditions are likely to start developing. We will extend to more ages over time.
