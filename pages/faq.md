#### **Ecosystem**
**2. What is the scope of preventive health measures in enrolment and primary care?**

Each individual will meet with their family doctor for a first visit after enrolment and discuss the relevant preventive health measures. This could comprise recommendations on nationally recommended screening and vaccinations and increasing physical activity and improving diet. 

**3. I am a food merchant and want to support healthy eating. What can I look forward to, as part of Healthier SG?**

Today, the Health Promotion Board (HPB) has various programmes to support merchants who carry healthier F&B products. These include:

* The Healthier Choice Symbol programme, which enables you to reach more consumers through the *[Eat, Drink, Shop Healthy Challenge](https://www.healthhub.sg/programmes/136/eat-drink-shop-healthy-challenge)* by rewarding consumers for choosing healthier options, thereby promoting your brand and growing the sales of your products. You can find out if your company’s product is eligible to carry the Healthier Choice Symbol by looking at the [Healthier Choice Symbol Nutrition Guidelines](https://www.hpb.gov.sg/docs/default-source/newsroom/hcs-nutrient-guidelines-revised-april-2020v2.pdf?sfvrsn=a45eaa42_2). 

* The Healthier Dining Programme, which offers various funding schemes and grants to F&B operators who work with HPB to offer lower-calorie options and dishes with healthier ingredients are part of their core menu offerings.  

Stay tuned for future developments, and we encourage you to share any [feedback](https://form.gov.sg/#!/6254f4af045bce0012fc5a8b) you might have, with us.

#### **Enrolment**

**4. What is Healthier SG? How will Healthier SG help me?**

Healthier SG focuses on supporting you to build a long-term relationship with a regular family doctor  and to take steps for better health for yourself.  Studies have shown that people who go to one family doctor consistently, are generally healthier and have fewer hospitalisation and emergency department visits.

The relevant health cluster will partner your family doctor to support you, such as via regular reminders and appointments for nationally recommended health screenings and vaccinations, link-ups with community interest or peer support groups and more coordinated care across different providers. 

Under Healthier SG, we hope to move beyond transactional care where patients receive treatment only for their presenting complaint, to holistic care supported by your family doctor, clusters, and other care providers.

**5. When will the national enrolment programme be launched?**

MOH is consulting the key stakeholders including the public and GPs, before finalising the details, and will share more details in the White Paper. 

**6. My siblings, parents and I live at different parts of the island. How do we decide which GP to enrol with?**

Under Healthier SG, you will have free choice to enrol with a GP/clinic of your choice. This can mean a GP further away from your home. 

**7.  If I enrol with one doctor under Healthier SG, can I still see other doctors? Will I still be able to use CHAS/Medisave at other doctors?**

You will be encouraged to visit your enrolled clinic for all your medical needs for continuity of care, as far as possible. If there is a need to visit other doctors, you can also do so. 

The current CHAS benefits will still be available at all CHAS clinics, including those you are not enrolled at.
